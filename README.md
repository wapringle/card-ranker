# card-ranker
This is a very simple webpage to illustrate drag and drop to move a few cards to ranking slots. Click on a card and drag it over a slot. 
On release the card will either snap into a slot or back to it's original position. 
I have added a few highlights to show when a card is selected or over a slot. 
I have also played around with the z-index as the cards had a nasty habit of dragging under other cards or slots.

The script drag2.js is a slightly patched version of the one I lifted from David Flanagan's (well thumbed) 
"Javascipt The Definitive Guide", a must for any javascript hackers.
